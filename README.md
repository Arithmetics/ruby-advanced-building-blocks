Odin Project Ruby Advanced Building Blocks: Bubble Sort, Bubble Sort By

Project 1: Bubble Sort

Classic bubble sort implementation.

Project 2: Bubble Sort By

Bubble sort but this requires a block to yield to and define whether a swap should happen or not.

Project 3: Enumerables

Built most of the classic ruby enumarable methods by hand. Only did them for arrays, hashes/ranges were left for another time.
