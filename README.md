Odin Project Ruby Advanced Building Blocks: Bubble Sort, Bubble Sort By

<strong>Project 1:</strong> Bubble Sort

Classic bubble sort implementation.

<strong>Project 2:</strong> Bubble Sort By

Bubble sort but this requires a block to yield to and define whether a swap should happen or not.

<strong>Project 3:</strong> Enumerables

Built most of the classic ruby enumarable methods by hand. Only did them for arrays, hashes/ranges were left for another time.
